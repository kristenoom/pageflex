Pageflex(R) Storefront Training Outline

Storefront enables you to define, auto-generate, and manage attractive Web-to-Print document customization sites. With Storefront, you can quickly and easily launch a Web-to-Print business where your customers can customize marketing, advertising, and other documents through an online self-service system.
